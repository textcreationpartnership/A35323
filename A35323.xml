            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE general unsuccessfulness of our Publick Ministry, hath been a great while the just and sad Complaint of those that <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Word,</hi> and look after the <hi>Fruit</hi> of that labour; And all sorts of Persons do yet give too much Cause, yea, more Cause than hath been formerly given, for the renewing of this Complaint. Various Applications have been made to various Ranks are <hi>Orders</hi> of Men, but still they have had the same issue, as in the Propheet's time;<note place="margin">Jer. 5.4, 5.</note>
               <hi>The poor know not the way of the Lord,</hi> and those of <hi>greater</hi> quality, <hi>have broken the Yoke also:</hi> Both wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly averse to the receiving of Instruction. <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Youth</hi> have likewise had their Portions of season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counsel, but the desir'd Effect is not hitherto seen; they that are but newly enter'd into the World, and they that are manifestly going out of it, still <hi>joyning hand in hand,</hi> and <hi>drawing Iniquity</hi> together <hi>with cords of Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65413:3"/>
            <p> In this mournful case, any serious Person might very well be stirr'd up to consider, what <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> are to be further used, and upon what <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> they are most likely to make some Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: And because it hath been sometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That God by his Spirit takes hold of <hi>young ones,</hi> when the <hi>Gray-headed</hi> Sinners are left to the ways of their own-hearts, (as the <hi>Parents</hi> of the Man born blind, unthankfully denied Christ before the Pharisees,<note place="margin">John 9.20.21.</note> but their <hi>Son</hi> confest him bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) it may afford a little the more Encouragement to continue dealing with <hi>them especially.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as they need to be Men of Eminent skill, who engage in the cure of <hi>inveterate Diseases,</hi> when one of inferior Abilities, may adventure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Wound that is fresh;</hi> so it may seem a more proper task for him that willingly <hi>takes the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place</hi> among the Children of the House, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the reducing of vain Prodigals, that are wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>dew of their Youth</hi> in the Service of Sin, than to perswade those to a return, who are <hi>full of days,</hi> and of wickedness at once.</p>
            <p>It is not altogether improbable, that Men may be somewhat the <hi>easier to be intreated</hi> by one of their own Rank; the Apostle intimates thus much, when he says,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.1.</note>
               <hi>The Elders which are among you, I exhort, who am also an Elder;</hi> and if by the like Argument, I might recommend the
<pb facs="tcp:65413:3"/>folloming Discourse to the better Acceptance of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> Readers, I shall reckon my self <hi>bound to thank God always, upon every remembrance</hi> of its good Effects, that he put such a Design into my heart, and enabled me in any measure to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. I am sure, That I cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably suspected of serving the ends of <hi>Vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> by it, and therefore shall not here raise such a suspicion by making the least Apology for its <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> I have sincerely studied, as far more likely to affect the heart, and be attended with a Divine Blessing, than the most pleasant and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>sound of words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ought not to be conceal'd (if it could be) that many-excellent and valuable <hi>Authors,</hi> have with vastly more advantage, as well as in much larger <hi>Treatises,</hi> written to the same purpose; and I freely acknowledge, that I should think my Pains in <hi>this</hi> very well bestowed, if it did but help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the serious perusual of some of <hi>them,</hi> which having been published some time since, may be now perhaps forgotten, or too much neglected. He that <hi>comes after</hi> all these, hath great Examples to <hi>follow,</hi> which I am very conscious of doing <hi>afar off;</hi> but I know, That God makes use of several Instruments and Means in his own Work; and many times those, who are under the least Temptaion of <hi>taking his Glory</hi> (if he prosper them) <hi>to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65413:4"/>for he hath <hi>chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty;</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is such a fulness in the Scripture, as truly renders it a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> and capable of <hi>throughly furnishing unto all good works</hi> both the <hi>man of God,</hi> and the <hi>babe in Christ;</hi> for it does so <hi>suitably accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi> it self to the various cases and conditions of all persons, that none need to be at a loss for particular direction, if they will faithfully seek it here. As every one's <hi>general</hi> Duty is plainly laid down, so our most <hi>special</hi> Duties are described likewise, which arise from the special circumstances wherein we stand. And among other things, the Holy Ghost is pleas'd to consider our differing <hi>Ages,</hi> for which reason he makes use of the beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Pen here in the Text, to write to three sorts,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65413:5"/>
               <hi>Fathers, Young men,</hi> and <hi>little Children;</hi> and he writes that which was proper for them all, according to those measures of <hi>spiritual improvement</hi> and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, which they might be justly suppos'd to make. All that receive the seed into <hi>good ground,</hi> do not bear <hi>equal fruit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 13.23.</note> some bring forth an <hi>hundred fold,</hi> some <hi>sixty,</hi> and some <hi>thirty:</hi> Now if we were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to those three ranks of persons which have been mentioned, it would be expected that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should produce an hundred for their share, the Young Men sixty, and the Children thirty.</p>
            <p>The Distribution made in this <hi>Verse,</hi> is exceeding pertinent: 1. <hi>I write unto you, Fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. Fathers</hi> are men of experience, and most conversant with <hi>Antiquity;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm 44.1.</note> often discoursing of men that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isted, and things that have been done long since; therefore it is their peculiar accomplishment, to be eminently acquainted with the Everlasting God, with him who was, before any thing else began to be. 2. <hi>I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi> Persons at <hi>this age</hi> are commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their activity, frequently delight in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Exercises,</hi> and are ambitious of conquest; and therefore in the flower of their years it becomes them to be valiant <hi>Soldiers of Christ;</hi> and if through Grace they are made successful against the enemies of their Souls, it is their greatest honour. 3. <hi>I write unto you little children, because ye have known the Father.</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and <hi>Childhood</hi> is not a season of much knowledge; but yet, even then, we usually are able to distinguish our <hi>Parents</hi> from other men;<note place="margin">2 Kings 4.18.</note> and therefore a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed understanding of God, who is far more to us than our <hi>natural</hi> Progenitors, should grow up with us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65413:5"/>And indeed, if in our tender years, when we first begin to speak, and discover some <hi>buddings of reason,</hi> we are taught to have some proportionable sense of our <hi>Father in Heaven,</hi> who hath <hi>formed our spirits within us,</hi> 'tis an happy presage of our future increase in Divine Wisdom.</p>
            <p>But intending this Discourse chiefly for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>second sort,</hi> I shall more largely handle what is written to them: and accordingly I propose this <hi>Doctrinal Truth,</hi> as the foundation of the whole, That</p>

               <hi>the tares are the children of the wicked one</hi> (says Christ) which in plainer terms, is the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil,</hi> as the same kind of persons are stiled in other places. It is the Character given to

            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis evident enough, that Antichrist is not here meant in the Text by <hi>the wicked one;</hi> for how could they be said to <hi>have overcome</hi> him, that had <hi>not yet appear'd;</hi> the <hi>mystery of iniquity</hi> was then <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but not brought forth: <hi>many Antichrists</hi> were risen, very dangerous and Heretical Seducers (such as our Modern opposers of the <hi>Godhead of Christ</hi>) but <hi>the Antichrist</hi> did not discover himself to the world till a great while after.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of those <hi>many moral Evils,</hi> which are reduced to one <hi>Original</hi> in him. The Devil is the proper <hi>Parent</hi> of most of the Sins, and of all the Sinners in the World; the greatest part of the Evils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, are by his Instigation; and the Persons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them, are his filthy <hi>Off-spring.</hi> It is laid down as an universal Proposition,<note place="margin">1 John 3.8.</note>
               <hi>He that committeth sin, is of the Devil.</hi> The several sorts of Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors <hi>have all one Father,</hi> for God acknowledges none, but such as are renwed, and <hi>begotten again.</hi> Satan <hi>teacheth the wicked ones his ways,</hi> and makes them <hi>do his Lusts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Evil Spirits have <hi>one</hi> that is a <hi>chief</hi> among them; or else, what is the meaning of the (<gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> This intimates some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and command, or it will seem to be spoken in vain.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is it to <hi>overcome</hi> this wicked one? To open this the more fully, I would do these three things. 1. Undeceive those, who satisfy themselves with a great deal <hi>less</hi> than is <hi>truly necessary.</hi> 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the mistakes of those, who think <hi>more</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than <hi>indeed is so.</hi> 3. Shew wherein <hi>real Victory</hi> consists.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To undeceive such as content themselves with <hi>much less</hi> than is truly requir'd to our <hi>overcoming</hi> of the Devil. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Renunciation</hi> of him and of his works in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> is not enough to overcome him. Such a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal defiance</hi> is often accompanied and followed with a <hi>real subjection.</hi> The application of the <hi>token of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65413:7"/>covenant</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> did not discharge him from the <hi>bond of iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8.13, 23.</note> Many of the worst <hi>enemies of the Cross of Christ,</hi> have been solemnly engag'd to fight under that banner. The Devil hath rather <hi>more power</hi> over some visible professed Christians, who have taken the Redeemer's Badge upon them, than over the most barbarous and bruitish Heathens; as the Uncircumcised Nations of old did him <hi>less service</hi> than some profligate <hi>Jews,</hi> whose Dedication to God had been sealed by <hi>Circumcision.</hi> There is no <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God which works as a <hi>Charm,</hi> without being pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically improved for our defence against our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies. If we only give our <hi>Names</hi> to the Lord, Satan may still keep as much as he desires, and be as truly our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> as if we had <hi>sworn Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An <hi>escape from gross Pollutions</hi> is not enough. A may may be as absolutely conquer'd by <hi>Spiritual Wickednesses,</hi> as by any other. Unseen defilements do as effectually maintain and support the Devil's <hi>Empire</hi> in the soul, as the most open debaucheries in the life. Inward <hi>lustings</hi> answer his purpose, as well as outward sensualities; the habitual <hi>lifting up of the heart,</hi> as well as the pride of countenance, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of apparel. He that <hi>fulfils the desires of the mind,</hi> tho not the <hi>desires of the flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.2, 3.</note> still <hi>walks according to the prince of the power of the air.</hi> No <hi>acts</hi> are so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, but that impure <hi>thoughts</hi> and vile <hi>affections</hi> will keep as firm possession for the Devil, as they do. A <hi>vain mind</hi> is his safe harbour, who he do not betray his influence by a notoriously <hi>vain conversation.</hi> A lurking sin in the <hi>bosom</hi> will be the Pillar of his <hi>Throne,</hi> when the behaviour appears most innocent and blameless.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65413:8"/> 3. A <hi>refusal</hi> of those <hi>Temptations</hi> which are not <hi>adapted to our peculiar corruptions,</hi> is not enough. If we would impartially and exactly know, Whether the Tempter be too <hi>hard for us</hi> or not? Whether he is Conqueror, or we are so? We must <hi>know what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are of,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 9.55.</note> and which way the <hi>bias</hi> of our Natural Temper <hi>draws</hi> us. We must not make those cases the <hi>Test</hi> where the Devil <hi>shoots wide,</hi> and offers sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions that we have little or no inducement within us to comply with, but where he <hi>directly hits</hi> our dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lusts, and lays the delightful bait before us. It may be, we can drive him from all his <hi>slendere Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> when he is solliciting us to other sins, but can we beat him out of his <hi>strong-hold,</hi> or stand against him when he <hi>falls in with the stream</hi> of our own sinful inclinations? If the <hi>Money</hi> had not wrought upon <hi>Judas</hi>'s <hi>Covetousness,</hi> perhaps his heart (as bad as it was) would never have been allured into so base a <hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A <hi>living in undisturbed Security,</hi> is no sufficient evidence of our overcoming the Devil, but rather gives suspicion of the contrary, They that are least <hi>troubled,</hi> are generally most under the <hi>prevailing power</hi> of Temptation. It is not for Satan's interest to <hi>terrify,</hi> where he reigns without <hi>controul;</hi> it much more concerns him to feed our <hi>presumptions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 11.21.</note> and lull us asleep by a <hi>false peace,</hi> lest our awakening should make way for our Conversion. If the Devil should ordinarily perplex and disquiet his own Subjects, they might <hi>bethink themselves</hi> of shaking off his yoke; and therefore he strives for the most part to make his Government easy, by <hi>stupifying</hi> those that submit to it. When we are least <hi>sensible</hi> of the Devil's opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is certainly most <hi>fatal;</hi> this is no sign of our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65413:8"/>getting ground against <hi>him,</hi> but proves that he hath more throughly subdued and vanquisht <hi>us,</hi> and that he now keeps us at his own beck.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To remove their mistakes, who make themselves uneasy by imagining <hi>those things necessary</hi> to our <hi>overcoming</hi> of the Devil, which are not. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not necessary, that we should be able to <hi>free our selves from renewed Temptations.</hi> Satan's <hi>final rebuke</hi> is not to be expected while we are here in the World. How many <hi>repulses</hi> soever he meet with, we must look for <hi>fresh Assaults;</hi> how oft soever we put him to <hi>flight,</hi> he will assuredly be <hi>invading us again.</hi> The <hi>King of Israel</hi> had smitten the <hi>Syrians</hi> with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>great slaughter,</hi> and yet the Prophete warned him,<note place="margin">1 Kings 20.21, 22.</note> that at the <hi>return of the year,</hi> the <hi>King of Syria</hi> would make another attempt. So it is here; the Devil's <hi>Power</hi> may be broken, but still there will be repeated discoveries of his <hi>fury;</hi> he will never give up his Cause, nor be <hi>out of hope,</hi> till we are <hi>out of reach</hi> in the unmovable Kingdom, and possest of the incorruptible inheritance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not indispensibly necessary to our overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Gospel-sense, that we should be Conquerors over him <hi>in every particular Temptation.</hi> He that is never brought to give his <hi>deliberate Consent,</hi> may yet be foil'd by an <hi>unwilling Surprize.</hi> Satans prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is not to be concluded from every <hi>Sin of infirmity</hi> or weakness; for <hi>who then should be saved?</hi> Or who then is <hi>recovered out of his Snare?</hi> The <hi>bruised Serpent</hi> is not utterly disabled from piercing us with his <hi>Sting.</hi> When the <hi>fiery Darts</hi> of the Devil are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flying so <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>swift</hi> was they do, it is not to be imagin'd that every one of them should be <hi>quencht</hi> as soon as <hi>thrown.</hi> A Man, who does not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65413:9"/>out of choice,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.27.</note> or with design, <hi>give place to the Devil,</hi> (which is the main thing that the Apostle forbids and cautions against) may nevertheless be sometimes <hi>over-power'd</hi> by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not necessary that we should enjoy the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and comfortable Persuasion</hi> of this overcoming in our own minds, 'Tis possible to have the <hi>Victory,</hi> and for the Enemy to be put to flight, and yet the <hi>Dust</hi> and <hi>Smoak</hi> may be so great, that we may not <hi>see</hi> or <hi>know</hi> it. Many a weak (and yet sincere) belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver under <hi>dark and melancholy Clouds,</hi> does think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>conquered,</hi> when he is at the same time <hi>more than Conqueror.</hi> It is the usual method of Satan to <hi>affright most,</hi> where he is capable of <hi>hurting least.</hi> He finds it no hard thing at some particular seasons to <hi>scare</hi> us with <hi>imaginary Wounds;</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> mourned for his Son <hi>Joseph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 37.31, 33.</note> supposing him to be <hi>torn in pieces,</hi> when his <hi>Coat was only dipt in blood,</hi> by the Artifice of his malicious Brethren, to cover the delusion. He makes us believe, that we have <hi>receiv'd</hi> his Temptations, when we have with greatest <hi>loathing rejected</hi> them; and that he hath fastened the guilt and defilement upon <hi>us,</hi> when the <hi>Sin lies</hi> no where but <hi>at his own door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not absolutely necessary to our overcoming of him, that there should be a <hi>total extinguishing of that principle</hi> in our selves, which <hi>disposes</hi> us to yield to him. The <hi>treacherous party</hi> in our own Breasts will not be utterly destroyed, tho the <hi>External Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi> be routed. Nor does any Man <hi>in Temptation wholly oppose</hi> that Temptation, tho he do get the mastery of it <hi>in the end. Indwelling Sin</hi> in the best of Saints will side with the Tempter, and <hi>set them at variance</hi> against themselves. The Believer in such
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65413:9"/>a case, is like a <hi>Kingdom divided,</hi> and yet he <hi>stands;</hi> but 'tis by virtue of those Divine <hi>Succours</hi> which are sent in to him, (of which more afterwards). There is always a <hi>war in our Members,</hi> and too often a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> there is at the best, a <hi>Contention</hi> and struggle within, which Satan gets <hi>some</hi> advantage from, but not <hi>that</hi> which he covers and labours after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To shew wherein the <hi>real Conquest</hi> of the Devil lies. This <hi>Positive</hi> may easily be gather'd from the foregoing <hi>Negatives,</hi> and therefore the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars need to be but briefly hinted. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Devil is <hi>truly overcome,</hi> when his <hi>Seat</hi> is thrown down, and an end put to his <hi>allowed Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If he be <hi>deposed</hi> from his usurpt <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and not suffered to <hi>Reign,</hi> he is really conquer'd. It is <hi>ruling Power</hi> which he aims at, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without the exercise of; if he cannot <hi>Lord</hi> it over the Soul, and sway the <hi>Scepter</hi> there, he loses his end. Wheresoever Christ is set up as King, and <hi>appointed to be head</hi> (by the Soul's free choice,<note place="margin">Hosea 1.11.</note> as well as God's powerful Designation) Satan is <hi>dragg'd</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his <hi>Triumphal Chariot.</hi> You whom Jesus go verns, are under victorious Grace, and not the <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led influence</hi> of sinful Temptations. Our great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary knows no middle Condition between <hi>tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon our Necks,</hi> and <hi>lying vanquisht at our Feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devil is indeed overcome, so long as we <hi>continue resisting</hi> him, tho we still <hi>continue assaulted</hi> by him. If we <hi>stand our ground,</hi> we make him <hi>flee;</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 4.7.</note> it he do not prevail over us, we do in effect prevail against him; as long as he is not <hi>entertain'd,</hi> he is <hi>defeated.</hi> It does not serve the Devil's purpose meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>molest</hi> us by <hi>Temptation,</hi> unless he can thereby
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65413:10"/>
               <hi>draw forth our Corruption.</hi> A <hi>Garison</hi> that <hi>defends</hi> it self, and gives continual Repulses to the Enemy, acquits it self very well, tho the Enemy do not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi> or abandon the <hi>Siege.</hi> So, if the <hi>door of the heart</hi> be still kept shut against the Tempter, tho the Devil (like those <hi>Sodomites</hi> in <hi>Lot</hi>'s case) do <hi>press sore</hi> upon us,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.9.</note> and come near to <hi>force</hi> it, Victory attends us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Devil is really overcome, when we <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the Sin</hi> into which we are fallen, by <hi>serious Repentance.</hi> He hath accomplisht the <hi>least half</hi> of his design, in making of us <hi>Criminals,</hi> except he can keep us <hi>impenitent.</hi> Our <hi>returning to God</hi> will (in some respect) undo all the <hi>work of the Devil.</hi> We may say in this case,<note place="margin">Mic. 7.8.</note> as the Church does, <hi>Rejoyce not against me, oh mine Enemy; when I fall, I shall arise.</hi> Our <hi>falls</hi> by Sin do not please and <hi>gratify</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan so much, as our <hi>rising again</hi> by renewed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version does frustrate and <hi>disappoint</hi> him. When he hath <hi>cast us into the mire,</hi> he still misseth his principal aim, unless he can perswade us to <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in it.</hi> He that's <hi>overtaken with a fault,</hi> and speedily <hi>restored,</hi> cannot be look'd upon as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's <hi>prey.</hi> The Tempter hath no cause to boast, if God <hi>heal</hi> us by his Grace, so that we <hi>dye not of our Wounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Devil is overcome, if God <hi>bring us off with victory</hi> in the <hi>close of all our conflicts.</hi> He that at the <hi>finishing of his course</hi> can say,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7.</note>
               <hi>I have kept the faith,</hi> may also safely pronounce, <hi>I have fought a good fight.</hi> The Battel may <hi>go against us</hi> several times throughout the <hi>Day,</hi> but if in the <hi>Evening</hi> our warfare <hi>issue well,</hi> we shall not be <hi>burt of the second death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2.11.</note> The Devil very often <hi>comes down</hi> against us <hi>in great wrath,</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65413:10"/>makes very violent onsets; and we may be <hi>seiz'd</hi> and <hi>retaken</hi> many a time before the end comes; but the <hi>end</hi> will <hi>determine all,</hi> and if that be successful, the reward is ours.<note place="margin">Psalm 129.2.</note>
               <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth</hi> (says the Church, of another sort of Enemies) <hi>yet they have not prevailed against me; i. e.</hi> they have not absolutely prevailed; for after all, I have <hi>emerged,</hi> and do still <hi>subsist.</hi> In short, <hi>the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of that <hi>Tribe</hi> belongs to believers, concerning whom dying <hi>Jacob</hi> prophesied,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.19.</note> that <hi>a troop should overcome him, but he should overcome at the last.</hi>

That this may not therefore be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood, these <hi>five</hi> following things are proper to be consider'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every Believer hath overcome <hi>in Christ as his head.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.37.</note>
               <hi>We are more than conquerors through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us,</hi> because he hath so gloriously conquered for us. He bids his Disciples to <hi>be of good cheer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 16 33.</note>
               <hi>because he had over come the world;</hi> and upon the same accounts we may take comfort from his overcoming the Devil, because he did it as a <hi>publick person,</hi> and therefore it turns to our advantage. Our <hi>General</hi> fought a single <hi>Duel,</hi> which gives <hi>success</hi> to his <hi>whole Army.</hi> The <hi>Second Adam gained</hi> as much on the behalf of his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed by overcoming, as the <hi>First Adam lost</hi> to his natural Posterity by being overcome. Our Lord <hi>having spoiled Principalities and Powers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Colos. 2.15.</note> his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects may also <hi>triumph over them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65413:11"/> 2. Believers have overcome <hi>in hope and expectation.</hi> They have the <hi>promise</hi> of God to assure them, that in a <hi>way</hi> of persevering watchfulness, and humble dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they shall be finally <hi>delivered out of the mouth of the Lion;</hi> and therefore they do as securely rest and depend upon it, as if their deliverance were <hi>obtain'd already,</hi> tho they do not flatter themselves by it into slothful and careless Presumption. Now there is so little <hi>hazard</hi> in trusting to God with our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who hath fully undertaken (after this manner) to effect it, that they which are <hi>called,</hi> and they which are <hi>saved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18, 24.</note> are but two <hi>Denominations</hi> for the same <hi>Persons.</hi> And those things which may with such <hi>confidence</hi> be expected, are in some sense, as if they were <hi>actually</hi> had.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have overcome in <hi>desire and resolution.</hi> They are seeking <hi>and striving for the mastery,</hi> and are in some regards impatient till they get it. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious <hi>Palms</hi> are in their <hi>eye,</hi> and they think it long till they have them in their <hi>hands.</hi> No <hi>fight of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> is so sharp and tedious to them, as these encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with polluting temptations. If they had their <hi>wish,</hi> they would not remain contending with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek in the valley,</hi> but get up into the <hi>mount,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with God. However, their fixed <hi>purpose of heart is,</hi> to hold out so long as God thinks fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their discharge: they will continue <hi>warring,</hi> till the very moment of their <hi>entrance into peace;</hi> and are set to <hi>resist evil,</hi> as others are to <hi>do</hi> it. Now he that seriously determines in himself, to make no <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Hell,</hi> may answerably promise himself an happy issue of his <hi>opposition</hi> to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They have overcome <hi>in part,</hi> they are snatch'd out of Satan's jurisdiction,<note place="margin">Colos. 1.13.</note> and <hi>translated</hi> (by a work of sanctification) <hi>into the Kingdom of Christ.</hi> They
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65413:11"/>have gained <hi>many victories,</hi> which are as so many Earnests and Pledges of the <hi>last;</hi> they have escap'd the rage of the murtherer of souls <hi>several times;</hi> and this comfortable experience emboldens them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they shall escape it. God hath kept them in <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>other hour of temptation;</hi> and from thence they justly collect the certainty of their future preservation; and in the language of the Scripture, that which is certainly future, is often set forth as present or past.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They may very well be said to have overcome, because it is but a very <hi>little while</hi> before their <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare will be accomplish'd;</hi> the Holy Ghost puts us in mind that it will be shortly;<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note> and what will shortly be, is <hi>as good as done.</hi> Our blessed Lord upon the <hi>near approach</hi> of his death, cries out,<note place="margin">John 17.4.</note>
               <hi>I have finished he work,</hi> &amp;c. which could not be strictly said till he had <hi>given up the ghost,</hi> for he was <hi>made perfect through</hi> his dying <hi>sufferings;</hi> and yet because his work then wanted so little of being compleated, he tells his Father, I <hi>have</hi> done it. So as soon as the <hi>thin va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour</hi> of this bodily life <hi>vanishes away,</hi> our triumph will begin, and it can be no very considerable space before <hi>that</hi> does so. Our <hi>whole time</hi> which we pass here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, is but a <hi>narrow edge</hi> on this side of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore <hi>when a few days are come,</hi> this will be verified of the faithful, which is now spoken by <hi>anticipation; Ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Kings 2.23.</note> as he taught the <hi>little Children</hi> of the City to mock a venerable <hi>Prophet.</hi> How frequently does he that was a <hi>lyar</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>dictate lies</hi> to those that are newly crept out of their <hi>Cradles!</hi>

               <hi>First,</hi> Look after <hi>a change of State.</hi> There is an indispensible necessity of this, to our <hi>getting out</hi> of Satan's Kingdom, as well as <hi>entrance into</hi> God's. Every man is <hi>born like a wild Ass's Colt;</hi>

Souls that are not <hi>subdued</hi> to Christ by the Spirit in the Work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> will never be released from their <hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Vassalage</hi> to the Devil.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be sensible of your own <hi>remaining impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> even in a gracious and <hi>spiritual State.</hi> As we are wholly <hi>without strength,</hi> before we are born again; so our own strength is not <hi>sufficient</hi> afterwards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out renewed succors. <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Son being but a <hi>Youth,</hi> was afraid to draw his Sword against the two Kings of <hi>Midian,</hi>

To the best and greatest <hi>Saints,</hi> if left to themselves, and unassisted by God. Satan is truly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.</hi> Therefore Grace <hi>already received,</hi> is not to be depended on, but the <hi>further aids</hi> of the Spirit. When we <hi>think</hi> we can do any thing, we can <hi>indeed</hi> do nothing; and as the Apostle said,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.10.</note>
               <hi>When I am weak, then am I strong;</hi> so on the contrary, when we are <hi>strongest</hi> in our own Opinion, we always find our selves to be really <hi>weakest.</hi> There is a vast difference between the success of those that <hi>trust</hi> on <hi>God's arm,</hi> and of them that <hi>lean</hi> to their own imaginary Power. <hi>Even the youths shall faint, and the young men shall ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fall</hi> (their <hi>self-considence</hi> will deceive and destroy them) <hi>but they that wait upon the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 40.30, 31.</note>
               <hi>shall renew their strength.</hi> If then, you will escape in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Battels, be deeply convinc'd that your <hi>case is</hi> like that of <hi>Jeh saphat,</hi> and your <hi>frame ought</hi> to be so;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.12.</note>
